                    <h2>Match 1 - England v Iran</h2>
                    <h4>First Half</h4>
                    <p>England had a pacey start with an early penalty shout when both Stones and Maguire were wrestled to the floor but VAR said no.  First shot of the game from Kane saved well.  Trippier and Keeper clash heads marvellously.  Very big nose to take a clouting.  Huge delay for medical treatment but the keeper stayed on for 2 mins before going down again.  Totally ridiculous.  Should have gone off straight away.  New Keeper on.
                        Iran seemed to improve for the 15 minute goal keeper rest.<br><br>  
                        Weak shot by Saka but at least we have 2 shots in 30 mins now.  Considering how bad the Iranians are this is not much for our efforts. 
                        A shot from Mason Mount goes wide.  Could have done better but going forward at least.<br><br> 
                        Off the post from Maguire.  Getting closer.<br><br>
                        Jude Bellingham scores our first of the tournament from a Luke Shaw cross.  Great header.<br><br>
                        The crowd sing Hey Jude!<br><br>
                        Goal Number two from Saka.  Corner and a great strike with a slight deflection after a Maguire head down.  Iranians complain for a foul but VAR says goal good.<br>
                        Third Goal from Sterling and now we are motoring.  14mins of injury time to play with.<br><br>
                        As the half comes to an end Iran have a good go and show that England can still be vulnerable.
