                    <h2>Match 3 - England v Wales</h2>
                    <h4>First Half</h4>
                    <p>England seem to have decided to keep things calm at the start. Lot of passing between Maguire and Stones.<br> Early break and shot from Rashford. Good Stop by Ward but nice move after 10 mins of cagey dullness. England seem inspired
                        a little.<br> Hopeful shot by Foden going nowhere.<br> Fifteen mins in and England have 75% possession but only one shot on target.<br> Direct free kick from a distance Rashford looks hopeful but Shaw looking at it. Might try something
                        clever. Bit tricky to Maguire at the back post but all a bit complicated to achieve much.<br> Another Free kick. England looking too cautious at times but getting more confident. Set pieces are rubbish though. Williams take ball
                        to the head and falls over.<br> No amount of commentary can make this interesting. We are playing very dull football. Corner, perhaps we can use it.<br> Niko Williams seems not have recovered from the ball to the head and is going
                        off. Conner Roberts on. Mandy happy to see a Burnley boy at the world cup!<br> A slicker moves sees a shot over the bar from Foden. The commentators go wild but it wasnâ€™t on target<br> Overhead kick from Rashford from a deflected
                        cross. Looks great but wide of the mark. To be fair the chances are coming.<br> Poor cross from Rashford stopped by Conner but England are starting to push in the last 5 mins of the half.<br> As the half ends goalless there is
                        a long shot by Joe Allan. Not great.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Second Half</h4>
                </div>
                <div id="match_one" class="match-box">
                    <h2>Match 1 - England 6 - Iran 2</h2>
                    <h4>First Half</h4>
                    <p>England had a pacey start with an early penalty shout when both Stones and Maguire were wrestled to the floor but VAR said no. First shot of the game from Kane saved well. Trippier and Keeper clash heads marvellously. Very big nose
                        to take a clouting. Huge delay for medical treatment but the keeper stayed on for 2 mins before going down again. Totally ridiculous. Should have gone off straight away. New Keeper on. Iran seemed to improve for the 15 minute goal
                        keeper rest.<br><br> Weak shot by Saka but at least we have 2 shots in 30 mins now. Considering how bad the Iranians are this is not much for our efforts. A shot from Mason Mount goes wide. Could have done better but going forward
                        at least.<br><br> Off the post from Maguire. Getting closer.<br><br> Jude Bellingham scores our first of the tournament from a Luke Shaw cross. Great header.<br><br> The crowd sing Hey Jude!<br><br> Goal Number two from Saka. Corner
                        and a great strike with a slight deflection after a Maguire head down. Iranians complain for a foul but VAR says goal good.<br> Third Goal from Sterling and now we are motoring. 14mins of injury time to play with.<br><br> As the
                        half comes to an end Iran have a good go and show that England can still be vulnerable.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Second Half</h4>
                    <p>Early free kick in a good position from foul on Harry Kane. No goal for him so far but this is not the Harry Kane show and he has played his part. Taking some treatment.<br> Trippier puts it straight into the wall. Bugger. Now Trippier
                        fouled. Might get messy as the Iranians tire.<br> Fine attack with Sterling showing a great link up with Kane and great pace. Well defended but England starting with confidence.<br> 15 minutes into the second half and England look
                        a lot more relaxed. Managing the game rather than pushing for the next goal. An ambitious low shot from 30yrds does not trouble Pickford or indeed get close to him. <br> Second goal for Saka makes it 4-0. Great goal with patience
                        and composure.<br> Iran Score. A moment when Maguire loses his man and suddenly 4-1. Maguire is down<br> Maguire off. Iran try to capitalise on 10 men but not quite for now<br> Rashford, Foden, Grealish and Dier on and Maguire,
                        Saka, Mount, Sterling off.<br> Rashford Scores with his second touch. Fine appearance.<br> Kane off, Wilson on. Hard to believe his grandfather was Harold and his Great Uncle Sargent.<br> Rashford still looks good for a second
                        but not this time.<br> Wilson brings the ball forward and lays it off selflessly for Grealish for a tap in. Fabulous 6-1.<br> 10 mins extra time second half that makes 28 minutes more than a quarter of a game extra. Iran finish
                        off with a shot tipped off the post just to remind us they came to that game. Now a last minute VAR check for a penalty. Iran have a penalty. Took about an hour to decide. 6-2. Bugger.<br> Not that it matters much England have
                        done the job. I took ten minutes to settle but after that is was never in doubt. Solid performance and hopefully sees us out of the group. Woot Woot!

                    <h2>Match 2 - England 0 USA 0</h2>
                    <h4>First Half</h4>
                    <p>Gareth Starts with the same starting 11 for the first time since a long time ago. They keep telling us when but I do not really care.<br> US definitely using the high press as predicted. England seem happy to let them for now but it
                        is making for a sluggish start.<br> First shot from Kane well defended for a corner. Looked good though.<br> Fifteen minutes in and England are starting to push. Looking hopeful but not yet scaring the keeper. US have their first
                        shot on the break but defended efficiently. Game must be a little dull as I am given to wonder what happened to the band with the drum and trumpets. Missing the Great Escape theme.<br> England getting hit on the break again. Need
                        to be careful. Nice bit of dinky stuff from Sterling but not enough movement off the ball to make it worth it.<br> US starting to settle and threaten as the half progresses and England look a bit disorganised when not possession.
                        Hearing the Drums and Trumpets in the distance.<br> Musah does a lot of rolling until the ref blows. Mount pretends to get hit in the face in revenge.<br> USA rattle the bar and England look fragile. Maybe more defending and less
                        arm waving would help.<br> As we get to 40mins England are looking short of ideas and looking at each other rather than taking the responsibility. USA knocking at the door and if it carries on they will score.<br> Another good
                        chance for the USA put wide. England looking poor.<br> Better from England. Good chance wasted as Saka skies it over the bar from 4 paces. Then another shot well saved from Mount. England finishing better.<br> Whistle goes. USA
                        had the best of a goal free first half. England must do better!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Second Half</h4>
                    <p>USA start off with more of the same but England start to settle and have a go. We need to learn that trying to slow the game and pass around the back is only going to encourage the US team to press higher.<br> USA with another corner.
                        They are just playing harder. Pickford starting to rattle. Could go full toddler at the swings in a moment. Now we are just shouting and each other. Arm waving increases.<br> Another US corner and another. This many they will get
                        good at them.<br> Can not help but think if we had practiced an offside trap we would be a lot better off.<br> Another corner and Another. This is painful.<br> At last a little shot.<br> Henderson getting ready to come on. God
                        Help Us. Grealish too though. That could help! Sterling and Bellingham off. Not sure at all<br> Twenty mins are left. We could pray for a 0-0.<br> 75 mins and the commentary team have started to talk about playing for a goal. US
                        sub McKennie for someone else I have never heard of and some other people too.<br> Saka off Rashford on. Maguire is holding a bum cheek. It is his own. Henderson sends a high looping nonsense cross to the keeper. !0 mins left in
                        this goal draught and the US swap some more people I never heard of.<br> England have a free kick. Games looks more like a draw than it should.<br> Bad shot from Rashford but at least he had a go. 89 mins and Hendo wins a free
                        kick.
                        <br> Rare corner for England in the first of 4 mins of extra time.<br> Harry Kane stuffs up a header from a late free kick. Oh end it now! Full time 0-0. England were very very poor. If this is England against USA what happens
                        against Spain or Brazil!
